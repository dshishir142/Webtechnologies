<h2>Educational Background</h2>
<p>
	Iam studying at Herald college Kathmandu at level 4 or bachelors level at first year in computer science. I got my SEE level certificate from Wisdom English Academy at Kalanki,Kathmandu. Also the entry level or +2 level was from NEB from Edmark Academy college. Both the SEE and +2 level certificates meet up the qualifications that this college needed. So I consider my educational backgroun very good.

<h2>Interests and hobbies</h2>
<footer>
<p>
	I personally am very curious about digital things. These small pixels glowing just through the command code written by people amazes me. And for my hobbies, I like playing video games. Apart from that I like watching all the cool things made through coding. For instance I just watched a 26 minutes video on making a animated wallpaper that would change its formation on hovering the cursor.
